# Lab 6 Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors to the Lab 6 Project pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We know that behavior contributes to creating a positive environment, and we expect 
behavior guided by the following principles:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Any behavoir that includes or is modeled after the following will not be tolerated:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. We do care how contributors 
act when they are not representing this project, however, that is their time and outside of our jurisdiction. With that being 
said, any violations to the Code of Conduct while participating in or representing this project
will result in termination of any relationship with the project and a permanent ban on working 
with us in the future. This Code of Conduct has a zero tolerance policy.
